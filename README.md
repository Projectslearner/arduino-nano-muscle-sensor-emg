# Muscle Sensor EMG

#### Project Overview

The Muscle Sensor EMG project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to read analog signals from a muscle sensor. This sensor detects muscle activity and provides analog voltage output proportional to the muscle's contraction level. The Arduino processes the sensor data and determines if muscle activity is detected.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Muscle Sensor EMG**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **Power Supply (Battery or Adapter)**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Muscle Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the muscle sensor to an analog pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure the ground (GND) pin of the muscle sensor is connected to a ground (GND) pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the power (VCC) pin of the muscle sensor to a 5V pin on the Arduino Nano or an external power supply.
   - Optionally, use a resistor divider circuit to step down the sensor output voltage if necessary.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the muscle sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure the power supply connected to the muscle sensor is appropriate for its voltage requirements.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the Serial Monitor for muscle activity detection messages.
   - Verify that muscle activity is correctly detected when muscle contractions occur.

#### Applications

- **Biomedical Engineering:** Monitor muscle activity for rehabilitation or physical therapy applications.
- **Sports Science:** Analyze muscle activity during athletic performance to improve training techniques.
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Use muscle sensors for gesture recognition or control interfaces.

#### Notes

- Ensure the muscle sensor is placed securely on the muscle of interest for accurate readings.
- Adjust the threshold value in the code to customize the sensitivity of muscle activity detection.
- Experiment with different muscle sensor placement and signal processing techniques for optimal results.
